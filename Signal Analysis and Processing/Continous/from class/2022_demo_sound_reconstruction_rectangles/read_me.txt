To see the signal and its approximant using pre-calculated projections, launch "rectangles_playback_2022_v1", then insert the appropriate data file name.

The data file name shows the number of rectangles used as power of two of the last two digits of the name. 
Example: results2_17.mat means that 2^17 rectangles were used.

If you want to recalculate the components and generate a new data file, you need to launch rectangles_projections_2022_v1.m
You can edit the data filename that is used to store the calculated data and you can decide how many rectangles to use.
